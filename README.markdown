# Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TroyGoode/node-request-upload-example.git
$ cd ./node-request-upload-example
$ npm install
```

# Run

In terminal tab 1:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

In terminal tab 2:

```bash
$ node client.js
```

Now grab what was output to terminal tab 1 (will look something like `/tmp/3e5ae9afca660e3e82eb01faab336838`) and in terminal tab 3:

```bash
$ open /tmp/3e5ae9afca660e3e82eb01faab336838
```

(replace with appropriate tempfile)
